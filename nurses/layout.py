"""Placeholder for a class responsible for laying out widgets on the screen.
For instance, adding two widgets to a (hypothetical) HSplitLayout(.33) will automatically set
the 1st widget to fill 33% of the screen's width and the 2nd to fill 66% and correctly positioning
the widgets.  Alternatively, you could place a Layout inside a Layout.
