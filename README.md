# Nurses

> Nurses is currently being rewritten to be platform agnostic with a dependency on `prompt-toolkit` instead of `curses`.  With optimizations for "terminal graphics" rather than TUIs. Progress can be followed here: [www.github.com/salt-die/nurses_2]

A portmanteau of Numpy and Curses. This library aims to implement curses widgets that have similar api to both
numpy arrays and typical GUI widgets.
